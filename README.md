### **Project Descriptions**

#### **Command-Line Tools**

-   **`kalkulator_cli.py`**: A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
-   **`tebak_angka.py`**: A number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

#### **Data Analysis Projects**

-   **`titanic_dataset/`**: This directory contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores the Titanic dataset. It demonstrates data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using the **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** libraries.
-   **`pandas_data/`**: This directory is for general data manipulation exercises using the **Pandas** library.
-   **`to_do_list_gspreedsheet/`**: A project that integrates with Google Spreadsheets to create a To-Do List application.

### **Usage**

To run a specific project, navigate to the project's directory and execute the script.

For example, to run the calculator:

`python kalkulator_cli.py`

To view a Jupyter Notebook, start a Jupyter session in the main directory:

`jupyter notebook`
